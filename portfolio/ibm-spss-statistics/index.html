          I’d like to say that this is by far the most complex project I have ever worked on.
          The first version of SPSS was released in 1968 and it used punch cards as an input.
          For half a century, this application was growing and it became a powerful tool for statisticians
          with more than 100 different procedures, tests and, analyses. Some parts of the application give
          users complete freedom in what they can do and it makes this project unique in terms of problems that
          we had to solve as a design team. Currently, it is one of the most widely used statistical applications in the world.

        <p>
          First of all our team was conducting research, we wanted to know what people think about the current SPSS version.
          We learned that less experienced users often were intimidated by the complexity
          of the software. Therefore, we focused on simplifying basic
          workflows and providing beginners with an easy onboarding to statistics and the
          application. Let's go through some of the changes that we introduced
          recently.
        </p>
        <h4>1. Navigation</h4>
        <p>
          We learned that a big amount of modal windows actually leads to high cognitive load.
          To solve this problem we minimized the amount of modal windows and used different UX patterns
          to make sure that users do not get lost in the application.
          Here is a short animation that illustrates our solution. 
        </p>
        <figure>
          <div class="demo">
            <input
              aria-hidden="true"
              type="checkbox"
              class="demo__checkbox"
              id="demo-1"
              onchange="setTimeout(() => this.checked = false, 10000)"
             >
            <label class="demo__play" for="demo-1"></label>
            <div class="demo__content">
              <div class="window">
                <div class="page">
                  <div class="modal"></div>
                  <div class="modal"></div>
                  <div class="modal"></div>
                  <div class="tab"></div>
                  <div class="topbar"></div>
                  <div class="sidebar"></div>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <figcaption>Tabs and a side panel instead of modal windows</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h4>2. Onboarding</h4>
        <p>
          One of the first discoveries we made was that first-time users
          needed to spend a considerable amount of time reading documentation and
          textbooks and viewing tutorials before getting started due to lack of
          familiarity with the domain and product environment. We determined
          the product needed an immersive getting started experience that would
          provide an easy-to-digest user flow and make intensive study or training
          unnecessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have created an onboarding experience that introduces SPSS and
          basic statistics to our new users. Learning by doing is the best way
          to explore a new application and we use this principle in the
          onboarding process.
        </p>

        </figure>
        <h4>3. Iterative Workflow</h4>
        <p>
          We talked to experienced users as well, and for them, it's important
          to keep focus and do productive work. We introduced an iterative workflow
          that allows users to make changes to the final results and, if necessary,
          re-run an analysis on a new dataset.
        </p>
        <figure>

          <figcaption>IBM SPSS Statistics - Analysis</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h4>4. Small details</h4>
        <p>
          We worked not only on big stories and flows but we tried to add small touches in all parts
          of the application. One of the examples is the very first interaction of a new user with
          the application in which SPSS welcomes the user in different languages.

          We redesigned a lot of aspects of IBM SPSS Statistics that I didn't
          cover here.
          Our ultimate goal is to invent a better way for people to interact
          with statistical software.
        </p>
        <h3>My Role</h3>
        <p>
          As a UX Engineer, I use my software engineering and design skills to
          works on product design. I’m a technical voice in our design team and I
          help other designers to better understand the constraints that we have
          in the software. At the same time, I work closely with the development
          team to contribute and learn more about our codebase and the
          application itself.
        </p>
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
          Design teams at IBM consist of User Researchers, UX Designers, Visual
          Designers, and UX Engineers. As a member of a design team, I work on UX
          concepts and prototypes. I am involved in all steps of the design
          process and partly in the engineering process.
          Here are the main steps of the design and development process.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Research</li>
          <li>UX/Interaction design</li>
          <li>Prototyping</li>
          <li>User tests</li>
          <li>Visual design</li>
          <li>Engineering</li>
          <li>Review</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The process is not linear and at any point of time, we go back to rework something.
          I'd like to cover a few steps of the process where I'm involved the most.
        </p>

        <h4>UX/Interaction design</h4>
        <figure>
          <img
            class="article__img article__img--shadow"
            width="800"
            src="/images/user-journey.png"
            alt="User journey map"

          <figcaption>A sample user journey map (<a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/user-journey-maps-or-user-flows-what-to-do-first-48e825e73aa8">source</a>)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Based on research outcomes our team defines a couple of
          <a
            href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/framework/keys/hills"
            target="_blank"
          >hills</a>
          (statements, big goals). Usually, we divide our team to smaller squads and we work
          on different hills in parallel. First of all, we build a user journey map based on research artifacts. 
          Our goal is to understand pain points and make sure that we keep existing positive user experiences. 
          We work on big ideas and define to-be scenarios. That’s
          the time where we use paper prototypes and storytelling to communicate
          our ideas and concepts to the users to select the best ideas. While we
          are building UX concepts we take time to make a few
          <a
            href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/framework/keys/playbacks"
            target="_blank"
          >playbacks</a>
          to align with the engineering team and check the feasibility of our ideas.
        </p>

        <h4>Prototyping</h4>
        <figure>
          <img
            class="article__img article__img--shadow"
            width="800"

            alt="Paper prototype"

          <figcaption>A sample paper prototype (<a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/a-guide-to-paper-prototyping-testing-for-web-interfaces-49e542ba765f">source</a>)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The to-be scenarios are mostly focused on user emotions and do not
          cover user interfaces that much. This is why the next step for us is to
          bring the stories back to the screen and we use prototyping for this.
          Together with UX designers, I work on medium-fidelity prototypes and
          after a few iterations, we get together with other team members to show
          our work. The review sessions are essential for our team. People
          work on different topics but it’s crucial to share what we do.
          It helps us to align, get other opinions, but most importantly, be consistent
          in the UX patterns that we use across the application. After the review
          session, we decide what exactly we want to test with the
          <a
            href="https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/framework/keys/sponsor-users"
            target="_blank"
          >sponsor users</a>
          and I create a few interactive prototypes using HTML and JavaScript.
          This is the time for UX Engineers to shine. I build prototypes based
          on a user test scenario. In our team, we use pair programming technique
          to work on interactions and animations. It’s not classic pair programming
          because the second person is a UX designer so the conversation is mostly
          around motion design.
        </p>
        <h4>User tests</h4>
        <p>
          The next step is user testing where we show our work. Depending on
          the scenario we use qualitative or quantitative user tests.
          I really like to participate as an observer and watch how our users interact with prototypes.
          Each time I understand a bit better how the users think and I see many
          opportunities and ways to improve the application even more. Most of the time after
          the user tests we go back to UX concepts or just tweak already created
          prototypes and then we test everything again. After a couple of
          iterations, we can move forward to the visual design.
        </p>
        <h4>Engineering</h4>
        <p>
          As a UX Engineer, I contribute to the source code of the application. I
          support our engineering team and help with animations and interactions. 
          I enjoy solving complex problems that all software engineers solve on a daily basis.
          Close collaboration with our engineering team is a great way to learn more about
          the application as well as the people who build it.
        </p>
        <h4>Review</h4>
        <p>
          The last step for the design team is the implementation review. We want to make sure
          that both UX and visual designs were implemented correctly. After a few
          reviews and additional user tests, we release an update.
        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          Here is a tweet that summarizes our work.
          We did improve the application, but we still have many opportunities to make SPSS Stats even better.
