        <p>
          Here I'd like to list a few of my personal and university projects.
          Some of them I've created for fun, others were part of my studying.
          Working on a side project is a great way for me to get hands-on new technologies.

        <h3>1. Boost</h3>

          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8Vb_9vFipo" target="_blank">Boost2</a>
          game that I and
          <a href="https://github.com/peetwriter" target="_blank">Petro</a>
          created at the RWTH Aachen university within a computer graphics course. We used WebGL and
          <a href="https://threejs.org" target="_blank">Three.js</a> to build this game. It took us around
          1 month in Jan 2014 to create it.

        <p>
          Another project for RWTH Aachen University that I've created together with
          <a href="https://github.com/bagabont" target="_blank">Momchil</a> and
          <a href="https://github.com/peetwriter" target="_blank">Petro</a> in Jan 2015.
          Hotkey ninja is a fun way to learn keyboard commands. In this game, each player sees a bubble that shows action
          and in order to hit the opponent, a player has to press the appropriate keyboard command. On the screenshot, we are
          practicing "Notepad++" text editor and I received the "Redo" command, as soon as I press "ctrl+y" my fighter hits the
          opponent. If a player uses a wrong keyboard command then the app shows the correct answer.

          Check out this
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_ClpqBDfBo" target="_blacnk">video</a> that shows how it works.
          We used Node.Js, MongoDB, Socket.IO, and WebRTC to build this project, it's not available online but you can check the
          <a href="https://github.com/bagabont/hotkey-ninja" target="_blank">source code</a> on GitHub.

          This is my master thesis project. I've used heatmaps to expand the capabilities of a standard video player and PDF viewer to show the
          most viewed/read parts of any learning material.
          The main goal is to increase the speed of searching for relevant information and at the same time increase the involvement in learning processes.

          I was working on it from June to November 2015.
